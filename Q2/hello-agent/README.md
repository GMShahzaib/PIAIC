# Hello Agent 👋

This is a simple Python project that uses the OpenAI API to create an agent that says "Hello, world!". It uses the UV package manager to manage dependencies and run the script.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API key
- UV package manager

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the project:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GMShahzaib/PIAIC.git
cd Q2/hello-agent
````

2. **Create virtual environment and install packages:**

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install openai python-dotenv
```

3. **Create a `.env` file and add your API key:**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. **Run the agent:**

```bash
uv run run-hello-agent
```

## ✅ Output

```
Initializing agent...
Agent says: Hello, world!
```

## 📝 Notes

* The script is in `agent_hello.py`
* Script entry is configured in `pyproject.toml`
* `.env` is used to keep the API key secret
